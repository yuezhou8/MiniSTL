## Time Complexity Analysis of vector in my MiniSTL
### The Average Insertion Complexity by doubling the capacity when the vector is full is $\theta(1)$
The key point in the derivation below is that the complexity of geometric series is bound by O(n)
### Indexing element
 $\theta(1)$
### Deleting element(pop)
 $\theta(1)$
